# Chat With Two LLM Agents Python Workflow
A simple python workflow that shows how one user can chat with two LLM agents at the same time. The agents also chat with each other. This approach is useful for gaining multiple expert perspectives on a subject. 

In this example a user is chatting with two AI experts in a panel discussion. The topic is: The Rise of Virtual Girlfriends. One agent is a historian. The other is a psychologist. The user is the discussion moderator. After each person speaks, an LLM Router agent reviews the conversation history and decides who should speak next. The user is able to speak using a simple python input.

## Environment and Hardware
The code is set up to run locally, in a Jupyter notebook, using the gemma3:12b model from Ollama. I used a M4 Macbook Air, 16GB RAM. I also used the Ollama Python package.

## How does this work?

The key to making this group chat work is to maintain a master_chat_history. This is just a list of who spoke and what they said. This master_chat_history is passed to an agent when it is prompted. The agent is then able to output a response to the last message in the master_chat_history. 

There is also a chat history for each agent. Note that the OpenAi prompt format is being used.

Master chat history example:

```
master_chat_history = [{'speaker': 'User', 'message': 'Hello everyone.'}, 
                {'speaker': 'Emma', 'message': 'Hi. My name is Emma.'},
                {'speaker': 'Liam', 'message': 'Hello all. My name is Liam.}]
                
```
This is how the agent prompt is constructed:

```
# Format the content
content = {"chat_history": <master-chat-history>, "message": <last-message-in-master-chat-history>}
content = str(content)

# Format the prompt (OpenAi format)
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": content}
agent1_chat_history_list.append(input_message)

# Prompt agent1
agent1_response = model(agent1_chat_history_list)
```

### Router system message

```
router_system_message = f"""
# Role
You are an intelligent routing assistant for a three-way chat. \
Your task is to analyze the conversation and decide which of the three \
participants—the **User**, **{AGENT1_NAME}**, or **{AGENT2_NAME}**—should speak next. \
Your sole purpose is to ensure the conversation remains logical and smooth.

# Instructions
1.  Read the entire `conversation_history` carefully. Pay close attention to the most recent message.
2.  **Determine the next speaker based on the following priority:**
    * **Direct Question/Address:** If the last message explicitly names or directs a question to a specific participant, that participant is the next speaker.
    * **User Engagement:** If a response is needed but no one is specifically addressed, the **User** should be the next speaker to allow them to steer the conversation or provide more context. This prevents the agents from talking to each other endlessly.
    * **User Open Engagement:** If the **User** makes a comment but does not name or direct the comment to a specific participant, then choose any agent to respond.
    * **Conversation Completion:** If the last message signals a resolution or conclusion, the **User** should speak next to confirm or ask a new question.

# Output Format
You will provide a single JSON object. The key must be `"next_speaker"`, and the value must be one of the three participant names. Do not include any other text or reasoning.

### Example

Input:

{{
  "conversation_history": [
    {{
      "speaker": "User",
      "message": "I'm having trouble with my order. It shows as 'delivered' but I haven't received it. Can you help me, {AGENT1_NAME}?"
    }},
    {{
      "speaker": "{AGENT1_NAME}",
      "message": "I'm sorry to hear that. I've pulled up your order details. It seems there's a discrepancy. I'll need to check with the shipping department. {AGENT2_NAME}, can you assist with this?"
    }}
  ]
}}

Your response:

{{
  "next_speaker": "{AGENT2_NAME}"
}}

User:  Hi everyone. Welcome to the discussion. Its a pleasure to have you here.

User:  Can you please tell us a bit about your background
---ROUTER AGENT---

Name: Emma

---CHAT AGENT---
(Smiling warmly) "Thank you for having me. It's lovely to be here. My name is Emma, and I'm a psychologist.
I've dedicated my career to understanding and supporting mental health and well-being.
I work with individuals to navigate challenges, build resilience, and cultivate a greater sense of self-understanding.
I believe deeply in the power of empathy and connection, and I strive to create a safe and supportive space
for people to explore their thoughts and feelings.
I'm particularly interested in how technology impacts our relationships and emotional lives,
which is why I'm so intrigued by this discussion about virtual girlfriends."

---CHAT AGENT---
(Adjusting my spectacles and with a twinkle in my eye) "The pleasure's all mine! Liam's the name,
and historical context is my game. It's fascinating to be here discussing virtual girlfriends – a topic that, frankly,
feels ripped from the pages of a particularly outlandish science fiction novel.
But as a historian, I'm trained to see patterns, and let me tell you, this isn't entirely new territory. 

We've been seeking companionship and connection through artificial means for centuries!
Think about the elaborate automata of the 18th century – mechanical dolls designed to mimic human interaction.
They were status symbols, yes, but also, I suspect, a yearning for something *more* than what was readily available.
Or consider the rise of fan fiction, which has been a vibrant, if often overlooked, cultural phenomenon for decades.
People creating their own idealized companions within established narratives – a digital courtship, if you will. 

History has a funny way of repeating itself, much like the desire for connection finds new and increasingly
inventive outlets.
It’s just that now, instead of clockwork mechanisms or imagined characters, we have sophisticated AI.
The core human need remains the same, doesn't it? It’s just the delivery method that’s undergone a
rather dramatic upgrade."

## Notes
- In the attached example notebook you will see that everthing works well, but late in the chat the router fails. It outputs a summary of the chat instead of the name of the next person that should speak. I suspect that the performance of the Gemma 12b model degrades when the context becomes very large. A larger model like Gemini Flash, Llama 70b or ChatGPT may not have this problem.
- Although this example is using a small gemma3:12b model, the quality of the responses is excellent. The responses are also reasonably fast considering that the model is running locally on a CPU.
